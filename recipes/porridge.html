<h2>The easiest and tastiest breakfast recipe you will ever eat!</h2>

<p>Very few ingredients, 10 minutes or less actually and you have 
    the best and most delicious restaurant quality (and better!!) 
    oatmeal porridge ready for breakfast. Here's how to make it!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3/4 cup regular or nondairy milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
    <li>1-2 tablespoon high-quality cocoa powder</li>
    <li>2/3 cup oats gluten-free if desired</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup or honey</li>
    <li>toppings of your choice</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>


<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Add the milk to a pot and bring to a simmer. Add in the 
        oats and a teaspoon of salt and cinnamon.</li>
    <li>Cook, stirring occasionally for the porridge not to stick 
        to the bottom of the pot. Stir until the oats are creamy 
        and have absorbed the liquid, about 5-8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add a little more liquid if needed. I usually add more 
        because I like more liquid-y looking porridge.</li>
    <li>Stir in cocoa powder, maple syrup (or leave it to drizzle 
        on top later), vanilla, and coconut milk. Remove from the 
        heat and cover for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer to your favorite serving bowls and decorate with 
        plenty of toppings, butter, pear butter, peanut butter, 
        fruits and more.</li>
